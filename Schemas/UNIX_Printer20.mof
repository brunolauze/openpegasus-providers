       "superclass (or top of the inheritance tree) for the "
       "non-association classes in the CIM Schema." )]

      [Description ( 
          "InstanceID is an optional property that may be used to "
          "opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of this class "
          "within the scope of the instantiating Namespace. Various "
          "subclasses of this class may override this property to "
          "make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also "
          "modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness "
          "that are defined below.\n"
          "To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of "
          "InstanceID should be constructed using the following "
          "\"preferred\" algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon "
          "(:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, "
          "trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by "
          "the business entity that is creating or defining the "
          "InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the "
          "business entity by a recognized global authority. (This "
          "requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> "
          "structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure "
          "uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When "
          "using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in "
          "InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should "
          "not be reused to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If not null and the above "
          "\"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity "
          "must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused "
          "across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other "
          "providers for the NameSpace of this instance. \n"
          "If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the "

          "implementation or shall be a, (possibly different), "
          "non-null value if the implementation does support Generation.\n"
          "After creation and if supported, Generation shall be "
          "updated, at least once per access, whenever the "
          "represented resource is modified, regardless of the "
          "source of the modification.\n"
          "Note: the Generation value only needs to be updated once "
          "between references, even if the resource is updated many "
          "times. The key point is to assure that it will be "
          "different if there have been updates, not to count each update.\n"
          "Note: unless otherwise specified, the value of "
          "Generation within one instance is not required to be "
          "coordinated with the value of Generation in any other instance.\n"
          "Note:the semantics of the instance, (as defined by its "
          "creation class), define the underlying resource. That "
          "underlying resource may be a collection or aggregation "
          "of resources. And, in that case, the semantics of the "
          "instance further define when updates to constituent "
          "resources also require updates to the Generation of the "
          "collective resource. Default behavior of composite "
          "aggregations should be to update the Generation of the "
          "composite whenever the Generation of a component is updated.\n"
          "Subclasses may define additional requirements for "
          "updates on some or all of related instances.\n"
          "For a particular instance, the value of Generation may "
          "wrap through zero, but the elapsed time between wraps "
          "shall be greater than 10\'s of years.\n"
          "This class does not require Generation to be unique "
          "across instances of other classes nor across instances "
          "of the same class that have different keys. Generation "
          "shall be different across power cycles, resets, or "
          "reboots if any of those actions results in an update. "
          "Generation may be different across power cycles, resets, "
          "or reboots if those actions do not result in an update. "
          "If the Generation property of an instance is non-null, "
          "and if any attempt to update the instance includes the "
          "Generation property, then if it doesn\'t match the "
          "current value, the update shall fail.\n"
          "The usage of this property is intended to be further "
          "specified by applicable management profiles. \n"
          "Typically, a client will read the value of this property "

          "modifies the instance in some means. This may be via an "
          "explicit parameter in an extrinsic method or via an "
          "embedded value in an extrinsic method or intrinsic operation.\n"
